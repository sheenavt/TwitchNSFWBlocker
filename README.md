Quick Greasemonkey/Tampermonkey script to block 18+ content on twitch

**The script removes any stream from tag or category view which has 18+ in the stream title or NSFWartist as a tag. Will expand tags as I notice more.**

You will need an extension that supports UserScripts. Below are the extensions available for most common browsers.

- Chrome: Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey
- Firefox: Greasemonkey, Tampermonkey, or Violentmonkey
- Safari: Tampermonkey or Userscripts
- Microsoft Edge: Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey
- Opera: Tampermonkey or Violentmonkey


**Once you have an extension installed you can click the below link to install the script. Next time you visit twitch the script should remove unwanted content.**

**Disclaimer**

I am not normally a javascript developer, so the code is likely not the best. Feel free to submit pull requests with improvements.
